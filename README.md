PROJECT: KNIGHTS TRAVAILS - Part of The Odin Project's Ruby Exercise

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.

Goal:
To build a method that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
